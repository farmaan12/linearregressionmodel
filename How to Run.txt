Point 1. Your main python file name should be application.py
Point 2. Your flask object name, which we have defined in application.py should also be the application.
Point 3. .ebignore  is responsible to hold the name of those files which we don't want to push on a cloud.
Point 4. Create a requirements.txt file.
        Command : pip freeze > requirements.txt
Point 5. Create a folder called .ebextensions
Point 6. Inside .ebextensions we need a python.config file.
Point 7. Mention the commands in python.config
            option_settings:
              "aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python":
                WSGIPath: application:application



====================================================================================

step 1 - create new anaconda environment
         conda create -n linearapp python==3.6.9

step 2 - install the requirements.txt (copy the requirements file to conda environment and change the working director of anacoonda cmd and then execute this command to work properly.
         pip install -r requirements.txt

step 3 - create txt filename as procfile
         there is no extension for this file // P should be capital in procfile
step 4 - initialize your project as git project
         git init
         git status
         git add .
         git commit -m "initial commit"

step 5 - do these operations in git bash itself
         heroku create
         git remote -v
         git push herolu master
